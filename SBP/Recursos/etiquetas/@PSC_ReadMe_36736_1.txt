Title: ADO Label Printer
Description: Update 6/21/05:
This is an address label printer. It was originally created for church use and mass mailings. You can have multiple files to help organize your address; the program will remember the last 4 you have opened. You can search for a specific address in a variety of ways. It allows you to move address from one file to another (one at a time or a selected group) by opening a selected paste file. You can Import/Export address from/to text files; you pick the field delimiter (Tab, Semicolon, Comma, or Carriage Return).
You can print a single address label, selected address labels, all address labels of selected zip codes, or all address labels in a file at a selected starting row and column. You can print a single page of labels beginning with the first address you select. You can use it to print nametags by selecting the print option "Print Names Only".
You can create and save different printing schemes which contain label size/layouts as well as what font will be used to print. You can view/edit one address at a time or view all the address in a spreadsheet format. In the spreadsheet, you can filter the information displayed to show only the address you want. The data in the spreadsheet can be sorted by column heading in either ascending or descending order. PLEASE READ THE README FILE.
